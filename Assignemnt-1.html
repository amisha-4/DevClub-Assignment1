        <h1><b>FAQs</b></h1>
        <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
        <h5>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. 
            Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. 
            Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions.
            Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more 
            than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying 
            medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</h5>
        <h3>What is Omicron?</h3>
        <h5>Omicron is the new variant of the coronavirus.The Omicron variant likely will spread more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus
            Vaccines remain the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19, slow transmission, and reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging.
            Masks offer protection against all variants.</h5>
        <h3>Should I use soap and water or sanitizer to protect myself?</h3>
        <h5>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. 
            Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, 
            coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. 
            If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</h5>
        <h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19 and what complications can it cause?</h3>
        <h5>People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms from mild symptoms to severe illness. 
            Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. 
            If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.</h5>
        <h3>What is the process for vaccination?</h3>
        <h5>You can register yourself for the vaccination at <a href="https://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in/"target="_blank">COWIN portal</a> and get vaccinated at the nearest centre.</h5>
